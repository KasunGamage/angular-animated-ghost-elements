Sometimes referred to as ‘skeletons’, ghost elements are gray-box representations of UI that will be available once async data is loaded or perhaps a lazy-loaded module is ready. 

> Ghost elements are very useful for implementations of complex tables and other UX where data loads are not trivial.

While many sites demostrate concepts of skeletons and CSS, the Angular community has seen an example with Angular and animations using `@angular/animations`. This repo shows developers ideas on how to partition, implement, and animate ghost elements.
